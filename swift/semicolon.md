## Swift에서는 semicolon을 써야하는가?

Semicolons
Swift does not require a semicolon after each statement in your code.   
**They are only required if you wish to combine multiple statements on a single line.**

Do not write multiple statements on a single line separated with semicolons.

Preferred:

```let swift = "not a scripting language"```

Not Preferred:

```let swift = "not a scripting language";```

NOTE: Swift is very different from JavaScript, where omitting semicolons is generally considered unsafe
